Nowadays every company may benefit from web technologies. This blog is to demonstrate how you can use them to your own advantage. It concentrates in particular on static web sites and tools used to create them. The blog itself is built using [ACT starter](/posts/act-blog/), which is a Gatsby starter to build advance blogs, documentation, and e-learning sites.

For more, read [posts](/posts/) and [code snippets](/snippets/main/intro/). Star ACT on [github](https://github.com/act-labs/gatsby-starter-act-blog "ACT Gatsby starter") or [contact us](https://www.facebook.com/ACT7LAB "ACT Labs contacts") on Facebook.
